================================
How it works

================================

The module defines a fuction `text_indentation(text)`

the funciton takes in a string of words and indents it removing  ., ? and :

===================================

>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Test case 1 (string):
        >>> text_indentation("my day was fine")
        my day was fine
        <BLANKLINE>
        <BLANKLINE>

Test case 2 (string beginning with whitespace):
        >>> text_indentation(" day was fine")
        day was fine
        <BLANKLINE>
        <BLANKLINE>

Test case 3 (has . ? :):
        >>> text_indentation(" day was fine? yes: it was.")
        day was fine yes it was
        <BLANKLINE>
        <BLANKLINE>
